31-may-2020 serj-tubin-backend service:
    Backend is now ran not by "go run ...", but first built, and ran via systemd

     - created systemd service config file
        - service name: serj-tubin-backend
     - check the service with
        - sudo systemctl status serj-tubin-backend
     - restart
        - sudo systemctl restart serj-tubin-backend
     - see logs
        - sudo journalctl -u serj-tubin-backend.service

     Monit monitoring available via:
        -   https://www.serj-tubin.com/monit/
        -   no services are still enabled
        -   to enable serj-tubin backend (or any other), it needs its service file (done) and PID file (not done yet), then it can be seen in the monit dashboard
