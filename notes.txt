some ideas:
    - utils page with things like;
        - migrate to new Hetzner server
        - (done ✅) your location, user agent, ip
        - (done ✅) weather tomorrow
        - (done ✅) some quotes
        - (done ✅) add linter (golang ci)
        - (done ✅) add some sort of versioning (last commit count or hash?)
            - add to frontend
        - use ansible?
        - use monit?
        - maybe add version info, to return it to site pages header
        - alarming (metrics), e.g. on too many requests, etc.
        - add URL shortener
            - with auto generated path
            - manually enter path
        - (tried ✅) use elastic search somehow somewhere (logs??)
            - https://logz.io/learn/complete-guide-elk-stack/#elasticsearch
            - https://www.elastic.co/start
            - go client:
                - https://github.com/elastic/go-elasticsearch
        - add metrics (graphite + grafana)
        - etc

31-may-2020 serj-tubin-backend service:
    Backend is now ran not by "go run ...", but first built, and ran via systemd

     - created systemd service config file
        - service name: serj-tubin-backend
     - check the service with
        - sudo systemctl status serj-tubin-backend
     - restart
        - sudo systemctl restart serj-tubin-backend
     - see logs
        - sudo journalctl -u serj-tubin-backend.service

     Monit monitoring available via:
        -   https://www.serj-tubin.com/monit/
        -   no services are still enabled
        -   to enable serj-tubin backend (or any other), it needs its service file (done) and PID file (not done yet), then it can be seen in the monit dashboard
